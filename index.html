        Hi there! My name is Caroline. When I was growing up, I never considered a career in technology. It just never crossed my mind, even though, surprisingly, IT is one of the fastest growing career paths in the world. Funnily, right now, I do love technology. And here's why; first, it's ever changing. There's never a dull moment in the industry. The change of pace in technology is faster than anyone person's ability to keep up. Secondly, technology is a great career for problem solvers and dreamers like me. Lastly, there's always continuous learning in technology. This means studying new technologies all the time. Hopefully, more people will learn to love the industry just as I do. While it certainly isn't for anyone seeking predictability, technology is an industry that rewards innovators and hard workers. I love technology!

        So far I have learnt alot about HTML and CSS. I never knew these two were used to make web pages. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language while CSS stands for Cascading Style sheet. HTML is used to put the structure of a website together and CSS is used to make a website look pretty. Is CSS important? Yes, CSS is very fundamental to webdesign. Without it, web pages would be just plain text on a white background. CSS is crucial because it gives a website its look and layout. Therefore, CSS offers the ability to for example, specify fonts, specify color, apply color to backgrounds and contain webpage elements in boxes.

    <h2>Third Section</h2>
    <p class="blue-text">In CSS, paddings, margins and borders are all different. How? Let me explain. CSS uses what's called a box model to display and space different elements on a web page. Padding is therefore the inner space between the content and the border of the box. A border is the perimeter of the box. A margin is the outer space surrounding the box. Padding controls how much space exists within a box while a margin controls how much space exists outside of the box. Padding can be set to zero pixels and above. It can show its own element's size and impact how much of a fill color or background image is visible within a box. Margins are essentially invisible barriers around a box. They define how an element interacts with adjacent elements or the edge of a screen. Margins too can be set to zero and above, but can also be set to auto and have negative values.
